# smart-street-light

this is a IOT project on smart street light system, where the street light will only glow when a car passes
through it and will remain off during day. It uses ESP8266 NodeMCU, micro USB cable, LED's, IR sensors and LDR 
sensors. Also the data of sensors will be displayed on a Thingspeak server by using API so that the amount of energy consumed
can be regulated.
