# smart-street-light
The main aim of the project is to reduce energy comsumption and increase effciency of street light and also operate them remotely
This is an IOT project on smart street light system, where the street light will only glow when a car passes
through it and will remain off during day. 
It uses:
* ESP8266 NodeMCU
* micro USB cable
* LED's
* IR sensors 
* LDR 
sensors. Also the data of sensors will be displayed on a Thingspeak server by using API so that the amount of energy consumed
can be regulated.
